# News App

![Hosted Site](https://lucyod10.github.io/news-app/)

This is a news website that compiles articles from a large variety of news sources into the one place. The user is able to filter the sources based on search query, news source and date.

It is a single page application which uses the API newsapi.org.

This project was created in React, and was an experiment in re-creating a previous project of mine for a new use. The previous project was created using jQuery and HTML/CSS, and was a blogging site with a firebase backend. It's repo can be found ![here](https://github.com/lucyod10/Noggin-News) or it's website can be found ![here](https://lucyod10.github.io/Noggin-News/).
